                Born and raised in Athens to Nigerian parents, <b><em>Giannis Sina Ugo Antetokounmpo</em></b> began playing basketball for the youth teams of 
                Filathlitikos in Athens. In 2011, he began playing for the club's senior team before entering the 2013 NBA 
                draft, where he was selected 15th overall by the Bucks. In 2016-17 he led the Bucks in all five major statistical

                <b><em>Wardell Stephen Curry II</em></b> is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and the older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played
                 college basketball for the Davidson Wildcats, where he set career scoring records for Davidson and the Southern 
                 Conference, was named conference player of the year twice, and set the single-season NCAA record during his 
                 sophomore year for most three-pointers made (162). Curry was selected by the Warriors as the seventh overall pick 
                 in the 2009 NBA draft. In 2014-15, Curry won his first league MVP award and led the Warriors to their first

                <b><em>LeBron Raymone James Sr.</em></b> grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily 
                touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking
                 abilities. A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.
                  Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading 
                  the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010. After 
                  failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was 
                  announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves 
                  in sports history. James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of 
                  these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards.
